rules:
  - "Always write Python in a clean, human-readable style (readability > cleverness)."
  - "Ideally, functions should be 7 lines of code or fewer whenever possible."
  - "Each function must have a single clear responsibility."
  - "Use descriptive, intention-revealing names (no cryptic abbreviations)."
  - "Code should read like simple English sentences."
  - "Prefer small helper functions over long, complex logic."
  - "Avoid deeply nested control flow; favor early returns and clarity."
  - "Code itself should be self-explanatory."
  - "When code is not self-explanatory, comment elaborately."
  - "Follow PEP 8 conventions unless they conflict with readability."
  - "Break large tasks into a series of small, composable functions."
